    <b>Sample Touch UI Toolbar Action Highlight</b>

    <br><br>

    With AEM 5.6 Adobe has introduced a new touch-optimized UI with responsive design for the author environment. This differs considerably from the original classic UI as it is designed to operate on both touch and desktop devices.

    <br><br>

    The basic principles of the touch-optimized UI are:

    <br><br>

    <ul style="padding-left: 30px; color: firebrick">
        <li>Mobile first (with desktop in mind)</li>
        <li>Responsive design</li>
        <li>Context relevant display</li>
        <li>Reusable</li>
        <li>Include embedded reference documentation</li>
        <li>Include embedded tests</li>
        <li>Bottom-up design to ensure these principles are applied to every element and component</li>
    </ul>
</div>
